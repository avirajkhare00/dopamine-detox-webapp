Okay, focusing on a web app that solely generates a dopamine detox planner as a PDF, here are the basic components you'll need:

**1. User Interface (UI) / Frontend:**

* **Input Form:**
    * **Detox Duration Selector:** A way for users to specify how long their detox will be (e.g., dropdown with options like "24 hours", "48 hours", "3 days", "7 days", or a custom input).
    * **Allowed Activities Input:** A text area where users can list the activities they *will* engage in during the detox. Provide clear instructions or examples (e.g., "reading, walking, meditation, spending time in nature").
    * **Forbidden Activities Input:** A text area where users can list the activities they want to avoid during the detox. Again, provide examples (e.g., "social media, video games, watching TV, processed foods").
    * **Goal Setting (Optional but Recommended):** A single-line text field or a short text area where users can briefly state their goals for the detox (e.g., "improve focus", "reduce screen time", "increase mindfulness").
    * **Scheduling Preferences (Optional):** A simple checkbox or radio button allowing users to indicate if they'd like a basic schedule included in their plan (e.g., "Include a basic time-blocked schedule").
* **"Generate Plan" Button:** A clearly visible button that triggers the plan generation process.
* **"Download PDF" Link/Button:** Once the plan is generated, a link or button will appear allowing the user to download the planner as a PDF document.
* **Basic Information/Disclaimer:** A short section explaining what the planner is for and a disclaimer that this is a self-experiment and not a substitute for professional medical advice.

**2. Backend (Server-Side Logic):**

* **API Endpoint:** A single API endpoint that will receive the data submitted by the user from the frontend.
* **Plan Generation Logic:**
    * This is where your Gen AI model comes into play. The backend will take the user's input (duration, allowed/forbidden activities, goals, scheduling preference) and use it to prompt the AI model.
    * The AI model should be instructed to generate a structured detox plan. This might include:
        * A brief introduction to the concept of a dopamine detox.
        * A clear list of the user's specified allowed and forbidden activities.
        * A section outlining the user's goals.
        * If requested, a basic time-blocked schedule for the chosen duration, incorporating the allowed activities. This might require some logic to distribute the activities reasonably.
        * General tips for success during the detox.
* **PDF Generation Library:** A library (like ReportLab in Python, jsPDF in JavaScript if you want to handle PDF generation client-side, though server-side is generally more robust for this) to convert the generated plan (likely as structured text or HTML) into a PDF document.
* **Response Handling:** The backend needs to send the generated PDF back to the frontend so the user can download it.

**3. Gen AI Model Integration:**

* **Choosing the Right Model:** A Large Language Model (LLM) with good text generation capabilities will be suitable.
* **Prompt Engineering:** This is crucial. You'll need to design effective prompts that guide the AI to create the desired output. Your prompts should include the user's input and clear instructions on the structure and content of the plan. For example:

    ```
    Generate a dopamine detox plan for [duration].

    Allowed Activities: [list of activities]
    Forbidden Activities: [list of activities]
    Goals: [user's goals]

    Include a brief introduction to dopamine detox, clearly list the allowed and forbidden activities, the user's goals, and some general tips for success.

    [Optional: If scheduling is requested] Create a basic time-blocked schedule for each day of the [duration], incorporating the allowed activities.
    ```

* **API Interaction:** Your backend will need to interact with the API of your chosen Gen AI model to send the prompt and receive the generated plan.

**Simplified Flow:**

1.  User fills out the form on the frontend.
2.  User clicks "Generate Plan".
3.  Frontend sends the data to the backend API.
4.  Backend takes the data and constructs a prompt for the Gen AI model.
5.  Backend sends the prompt to the Gen AI model and receives the generated plan text.
6.  Backend uses the PDF generation library to convert the plan into a PDF document.
7.  Backend sends the PDF data back to the frontend.
8.  Frontend provides a "Download PDF" button/link for the user.

This simplified approach allows you to focus on the core functionality of generating a personalized plan using AI and delivering it in a readily usable format (PDF). You can always expand on this with more interactive features and tracking in later iterations.
